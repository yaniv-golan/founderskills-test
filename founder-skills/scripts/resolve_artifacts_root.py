r"""Deterministically resolve the canonical artifacts root.

WHY THIS EXISTS: a SKILL.md ```bash``` block is guidance the agent paraphrases into its own Bash
calls — it is not executed verbatim. A computed path like
`ARTIFACTS_ROOT="$(ls -d "$(pwd)"/mnt/*/ | head -1)artifacts"` is exactly the kind of clever shell the
model shortcuts: it keeps the intent ("under outputs/") but drops the detection, landing `outputs/` in
one run and `outputs/artifacts/` in another. That non-determinism breaks cross-skill `find_artifact.py`
resolution and any path-based test assertion. Putting the logic in a script the agent invokes as one
opaque command removes the surface to paraphrase: the agent runs this and uses the printed value.

CANONICAL RULE: artifacts live under the **promoted outputs dir** in Cowork (so they're user-visible
AND resolvable by find_artifact.py), nested in an `artifacts/` subdir so the outputs/ root stays clean
for user-facing deliverables. In the CLI (no session tree) they live at `./artifacts`.

TOPOLOGY IS DETECTED FROM THE cwd STRING SHAPE, NOT FROM THE FILESYSTEM. This resolver runs in the
main-thread workspace shell, whose cwd is a DIFFERENT path space from the file tools'. On Cowork
host-loop — the production topology — that shell starts at the BARE SESSION ROOT `/sessions/<id>`
(branch 3 below), while the agent process, and so the file tools, sit at the outputs dir. Measured
upstream against desktop-local Cowork 2026-08-27 and pinned in cowork-harness >=2.4.0
(`hostLoopCwds`: `{agentProcessCwd: hostOutputsDir, workspaceBashCwd: sessionRoot}`).

An earlier version of this note asserted the shell sits inside `/sessions/<id>/mnt/<first-connected-
folder-else-outputs>`, citing the asar's "first-folder-else-outputs". That derivation came from a
`cwd:` spawn argument which is NOT load-bearing on the cowork path, so it described a prompt claim
rather than an observed behaviour; harness <2.4.0 emulated it, which is why branch 2 was the one
production appeared to take. Branch 2 is still REQUIRED — it serves the VM-loop tiers and any
pre-2.4.0 recording — but it is no longer the production shape.

**Branches 2 and 3 return IDENTICAL roots, and that convergence is the invariant that made the move
harmless.** Do not "simplify" either away, and do not let them diverge: a change that makes them
disagree silently relocates every artifact the moment the shell's cwd moves again.

The shell's cwd is NOT necessarily the outputs mount. Probing the filesystem for a sibling `outputs/` mis-anchors: if a
connected folder contains its own `outputs/`, an `isdir(cwd/outputs)` branch would point artifacts
INSIDE the user's real project while a sub-agent's host-native file tools (whose cwd IS the session
outputs dir) resolve the returned relative root against the outputs mount — write and gate then address
different physical dirs. So we key on the session ROOT extracted from the cwd shape and anchor
unconditionally on `<session>/mnt/outputs` (the bind-mount identity of the sub-agent's host cwd),
regardless of where in the tree the shell cwd sits.

Resolution (first match wins; pure string logic, no FS probe except the CLI mkdir in main()):
  1. $COWORK_ARTIFACTS_ROOT (explicit override / tests) -> (abs, abs)
  2. Cowork session tree, shell inside the mount: `^/sessions/<id>/mnt(/...)?`
                                                           -> (<session>/mnt/outputs/artifacts, "artifacts")
  3. Cowork session tree, shell AT the session root: `^/sessions/<id>$`
                                                           -> (cwd/mnt/outputs/artifacts, "artifacts")
  4. CLI default:                                          -> (cwd/artifacts, cwd/artifacts)
  $COWORK_AGENT_ARTIFACTS_ROOT overrides ONLY the agent-namespace half (see below).

Prints the absolute artifacts root on stdout (one line). With --json, prints
{"artifacts_root": ..., "agent_artifacts_root": ..., "uploads_dir": ...}. Creates the dir unless
--no-create. `--uploads` prints the uploads mount alone (exit 3 when there is no session tree) —
see `resolve_uploads_dir`.

THREE CONSUMERS READ THE SHELL cwd, NOT ONE. Beyond this module, `find_artifact.py` and
`founder_context.py` both default `--artifacts-root` to `os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "artifacts")`.
Every SKILL.md passes the flag explicitly, so those defaults are latent — but "the flag is always
passed" is a property of PROSE the agent paraphrases (see WHY THIS EXISTS above), and the cost of a
dropped flag changed with the harness 2.4.0 cwd move: it used to land on the correct root and now
lands at `/sessions/<id>/artifacts`, outside `mnt/`, where nothing is ever delivered and nothing
reports it. If you add a fourth consumer, pass the root in — do not re-derive it from `getcwd()`.

AGENT NAMESPACE (branch C hand-off): in Cowork a sub-agent's native file tools are rooted at the
outputs mount itself (its cwd IS the outputs dir), so the same file has two addresses — the main
thread's absolute path under the outputs root, and the agent's path RELATIVE to its cwd. On the CLI both
sides share one filesystem, so both roots are the same absolute path. Print it with --agent. Dispatch
prompts build OUTPUT_PATH (and under-outputs read paths) from the agent namespace; shell-side gates use
the absolute namespace.

**THE SHELL'S cwd CANNOT TELL YOU THE SUB-AGENT'S cwd.** Branches 2 and 3 differ only in how they LOCATE
the session root (from the `/mnt` match, or from the cwd itself) — which the ABSOLUTE root depends on.
They must NOT differ in the agent-namespace root, and a previous version's branch 3 got this wrong: it
returned `"mnt/outputs/artifacts"` on the premise that a shell sitting at `/sessions/<id>` implies the
sub-agent also sits there. Those are independent facts. On Cowork host-loop the sub-agent's file tools run
host-native with cwd = the session outputs dir while the main thread's shell runs in the VM sidecar, and
that shell can sit at the session root — so the premise produced `<outputs>/mnt/outputs/artifacts/...`, a
DOUBLED prefix, silently, for every blind-writing sub-agent. (See `references/skill-execution-model.md`
"a sub-agent's file tools run host-native (cwd IS the session outputs dir)", which this module's own
opening docstring already asserted.) Host-loop is the production topology, so `"artifacts"` is correct for
any real Cowork session tree.

REMOTE LANE (Cowork "in the cloud", the default for new sessions and where the Gracey report came from):
no `/sessions` tree; shell cwd `/home/claude`; `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true`. Artifacts fall through to the
CLI branch (`/home/claude/artifacts`, one shared filesystem, so both roots are the same absolute path),
which is correct. Uploads do NOT: see `_remote_uploads_dir`.

A genuine VM-loop topology (the agent loop itself inside the VM, cwd `/sessions/<id>`) does exist as a
test tier, and there `"artifacts"` would resolve to `/sessions/<id>/artifacts` — sandbox scratch OUTSIDE
outputs. That case is served by the explicit `$COWORK_AGENT_ARTIFACTS_ROOT` override rather than by
guessing from a cwd shape, because nothing in the shell's environment distinguishes the two topologies.
Set it to `mnt/outputs/artifacts` when running a hand-off-bearing scenario at a VM-loop tier.
