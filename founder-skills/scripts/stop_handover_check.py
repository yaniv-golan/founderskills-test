"""Stop hook: after the model's final turn, does the founder's message carry the printed hand-over?

WHY A HOOK. market-sizing prints its closing message from report.json (closing_message.py) so the
model has nothing to compute in chat. Three prose rules and two message shapes were measured not
to land (0/2 at hostloop on the last one): the model kept the links, dropped the pointer, and wrote
its own verdict with its own rounding. The message is the one founder-facing surface with no
script between the model and the reader -- until this one. Claude Code's Stop hook runs after the
final turn; a `{"decision": "block", "reason": …}` reply sends the model back once.

A BLOCK APPENDS, IT DOES NOT RETRACT. The faulted message stays on screen; the model's rewrite lands
under it after a user turn "Stop hook feedback:\\n<reason>". So the reason is written as a CORRECTION
the founder will read beneath the bad message, and Half 1 (the printed message already answers the
question) is the prevention; this is the repair.

TRIGGER FROM THE TRANSCRIPT, NOT THE MESSAGE. Keying on the message's first words fails exactly when
the model rewrites the first words. The trigger is a `closing_message.py` tool call after the last
real user prompt -- the same key the e2e lane uses. What is judged is EVERY top-level assistant text
after that call, not `last_assistant_message`: tool calls (present_files, TaskUpdate) sit between
the call and the final text on real runs, and text emitted before them is founder-visible.

LOCATE FROM cwd, NOT FROM THE MESSAGE. The model's `--report` path is in whichever namespace its shell
had (VM `/sessions/…` at hostloop) while this hook runs host-side; the links in the message are what
it may have rewritten. stdin's `cwd` is a contract: hostloop = the outputs host dir, Claude Code =
the working dir, VM-loop = `/sessions/<id>`. `handover.txt` is found under
`<cwd>/artifacts/market-sizing-*/` or `<cwd>/mnt/outputs/artifacts/market-sizing-*/`, newest first.

FAIL OPEN. Any error, any unexpected shape, any other skill's stop: exit 0, no stdout, one stderr
line at most. `stop_hook_active` true: exit 0 -- one rewrite is the budget. The skill does not
depend on this hook (test_skill_orchestration.py forbids that); it is enforcement, not plumbing.
