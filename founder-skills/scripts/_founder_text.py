"""Shared founder-facing text policy: what may appear in a report, and how to render it.

ONE module for the whole fleet, imported by each skill's `compose_report.py`; a per-skill copy would
drift.

Tokens that reach a founder are not all the same kind of thing, and a single rule is wrong for at
least three of them. Four types, three behaviours:

  1. PRIVATE ENUM — our vocabulary for a state. `more_diligence`, `partially_supported`,
     `purpose_traction`. A founder gains nothing from the raw form and cannot act on it.
     -> HUMANIZE. "More diligence", "Partially supported".

  2. FIELD NAME — our name for a slot. `evidence_source`, `switching_costs`, `customer_count`.
     Same argument as (1): it is our vocabulary, and the founder cannot act on the string.
     -> HUMANIZE. "evidence source", "switching costs".

  3. STABLE PUBLIC IDENTIFIER — `safe_001`. This is TRACEABILITY: the founder cross-references it
     against their own instrument. Humanizing it would actively harm them.
     -> KEEP VERBATIM.

  4. DIAGNOSTIC CODE — `ai_claimed_unverified`. A stable, greppable warning label whose value is
     that it does not change between runs.
     -> KEEP VERBATIM.

A blanket "no internal tokens" rule is wrong because it would rewrite `safe_001` and cost a founder
the ability to find their own SAFE. Glossing everything is also insufficient: a legend beside a raw
token still makes the reader hold a mapping while reading a judgement about their company.

The test is whether the founder can ACT on the token. An identifier is a key; an enum is a password.

# (`… is switching_costs.`), a real miss. Namespacing is specifically a dot ADJACENT TO a word char,
