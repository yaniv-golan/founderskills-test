"""Insert coaching commentary into report.md at the compose-emitted marker.

Deterministic replacement for the Context B agent-side insertion protocol:
the 6-state Grep idempotency matrix, the Edit-via-uuid-marker choreography,
and the run_id-parity verification previously expressed as natural-language
agent-body instructions. The agent now only composes the commentary text;
this script does everything mechanical.

Usage:
    echo '{"commentary_markdown": "..."}' | \
        python insert_coaching.py --report <report.md> \
            --marker '<!-- COACHING_INSERTION_POINT_a1b2c3d4 -->' \
            --verify-artifact <inputs.json> --verify-artifact <sizing.json>

    python insert_coaching.py --commentary-file <staged.json> \
        --report <report.md> --marker '<exact marker>'

Input JSON (stdin or --commentary-file): {"commentary_markdown": "<text>"}.
The commentary text is inserted verbatim as "## Coaching Commentary\\n\\n"
+ text, replacing the exact marker string (never the marker prefix).

Idempotency matrix on (commentary_count, marker_count) in report.md:
    (0, 1)  -> insert (the normal path)
    (1, 0)  -> already inserted; no-op success (resume-safe)
    all other states -> exit 1 with the same diagnostic strings the agent
    bodies used, so existing triage docs stay valid.

run_id parity: each --verify-artifact JSON must carry metadata.run_id and
all values must be equal. Parity runs BEFORE the write so a parity failure
leaves report.md untouched.

Write strategy: the new content is built fully in memory, then written in
a single in-place pass (open "w" on the same path). Never delete/recreate
and never os.replace -- Cowork's outputs/ denies deletion and rename.

Output: JSON receipt to stdout (--pretty for indented output; -o writes
the receipt to a file and emits a confirmation receipt to stdout).

Exit codes:
    0 = inserted or already inserted (receipt on stdout)
    1 = blocked (diagnostic JSON on stdout, human-readable line on stderr)

    WHY THIS LIVES HERE. Each skill's `compose_report.py` scans the report it assembles, but the
    Coaching Commentary is not in that string — compose emits a marker, and this script replaces the
    marker afterwards. So the compose-time scan structurally CANNOT see the commentary, which is
    model-authored prose and therefore the likeliest place for an internal token to appear. This is the
    one shared place every skill's commentary passes through.

    REPORTS, does not substitute. Two reasons: this script's contract is verbatim insertion (its test
    suite pins that, and transport fidelity for quotes/newlines is the reason the envelope exists), and
    commentary may legitimately quote the founder's OWN field or column names, which we must not
    silently reword. The actionable fix is upstream in the coaching dispatch template.

    Non-blocking by design — a token in coaching text must never cost a founder their report. Delivery
    enforcement, where a skill has it, belongs in that skill's verify gate.
