"""Generate a sub-agent dispatch prompt from identifiers on disk.

WHY A SCRIPT. On a live run the main thread hand-filled the RED_TEAM template and added, from its own
head, a numbered list of "things worth attacking" and an instruction not to re-read the founder's
documents. The red team's four findings mapped one-to-one onto that list, and it never opened the deck.
The step that exists to escape the constructor's framing was framed by the constructor, in prose no
test can see. Here the model supplies paths and ids; every sentence comes from this file; the e2e lane
regenerates the prompt and asserts the dispatched one is byte-identical.

WHY DOCUMENTS FIRST. The same four hypotheses were also in the artifacts (`gtm_evidence_notes`,
`competitive_landscape_notes`, `existing_claims_detail`), which the old template listed first. A reader
who opens the analysis's reading of the deck before the deck inherits its frame. So the founder's
documents come first, with an instruction to record what they say before opening any artifact.

TWO PATH NAMESPACES. In Cowork the main thread's shell runs in the VM (`/sessions/<id>/mnt/...`) and
a sub-agent's file tools run host-native with cwd at the outputs mount, where a `/sessions/...` read
is DENIED (cowork-harness 3.7.0 models it: dist/hostloop/canusetool-gate.js:123 refuses any
isVmSessionsPath). So this script CHECKS paths in the caller's namespace and RENDERS them in the
agent's: `--analysis-dir` / `--handoff-dir` are read from disk, `--analysis-dir-agent` /
`--handoff-agent` are what the prompt says. The founder's documents live outside outputs and have no
agent-namespace form, so Step 6c mirrors them into `<handoff-dir>/docs/` first; OCR sidecars sit in
`<handoff-dir>/ocr/`. Omit `--analysis-dir-agent` on a single-namespace host (the CLI) and the real
path is rendered.

OCR MUST HAVE FINISHED. This script lists whatever sidecars exist when it runs, and on a live run
that was a half-finished OCR: the shell tool timed out at 120 s, tesseract kept going orphaned, the
prompt was generated twice before the last two documents' pages existed, and the red team was told
those documents had "no machine-read copy". `ocr_uploads.py` now writes `<ocr-dir>/receipt.json`
per document; an image-only PDF the receipt does not cover is a refusal here (exit 2, naming it),
never a prompt that silently offers less.

Only `red_team` today; the generic shape is for the other dispatches once this one has proven itself
live. Output is deterministic for fixed inputs: sorted listings, no timestamps.

Usage:
    dispatch_prompt.py red_team --run-id R --analysis-dir A --handoff-dir D --handoff-agent H
                      [--analysis-dir-agent A_AGENT]

Prints the prompt. Exit 2 on a missing artifact or an image-only PDF the OCR receipt does not cover.
