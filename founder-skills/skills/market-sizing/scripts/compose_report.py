# (-32.5% on the shared fixture). That was originally read as noise; it is not. `existing_claims` is
# keyed by METRIC with no approach dimension, so comparing one claim against both approaches is
# established, deliberate behaviour -- it already fires today (deck-01 bottom-up TAM at -95.9%, one
# of the pilot's best catches) and the note renderer below has purpose-built per-approach wording for
# it. The only real gap is that this block's message omits the approach label that renderer already
# carries. So the band is a KNOWN GAP, not a design: a deck-01 SOM sits at -43.2% with no warning.
# Closing it = add the approach label here, then lower this to CLOSE_AGREEMENT_PCT.

    sizing.json never carries a top-level "tam"/"sam"/"som" scalar — each figure is

    numeric value lives at ``.value`` (see market_sizing.py's ``top_down()`` /
    ``bottom_up()`` output). The coaching sub-agent is told to reason ONLY from
    coaching_payload and never refetch from disk, so this resolves the nested path
    once here rather than leaving it undone.

    Selection rule for ``approach: "both"`` mode — documented here because nothing
    upstream names a winner between the two independently-computed TAMs: prefer
    ``bottom_up`` when both approaches are present, falling back to ``top_down``
    when bottom_up is absent (top_down-only mode). This matches the skill's own
    stated methodology preference (references/tam-sam-som-methodology.md:84 —
    "Prefer bottom-up for accuracy: Anchor TAM/SAM/SOM with bottom-up grounded in
    how your business works. Cross-check against top-down.") rather than inventing
    a new rule such as averaging or taking the larger/smaller figure.

    Returns (figures, source_approach):
