    market_sizing.py). Rendering the notes end to end therefore printed that 24-word caveat three
    times in one paragraph -- correct, and read once and then skipped, which defeats the point of
    surfacing it. So: every metric's leading sentence first, in metric order, then each remaining
    sentence once in first-appearance order.

    No prose is parsed for MEANING and nothing is reworded -- the producer still owns every
    sentence. Splitting is on ". " only, which cannot split a decimal ("9.4%") or a parenthetical
    ("(>30%)."). If the texts happen to share nothing, every sentence survives and the output is
    exactly what concatenating them would have produced, so the degradation is the old behaviour.
