"""
Validator for the RED_TEAM sub-agent's adversarial findings.

The sub-agent attacks a finished sizing analysis and writes a findings file.
This validates that file and produces `redteam.json`. It is a VALIDATOR, not a
detector: it never decides whether a finding is correct, only whether it is
evidenced well enough to put in front of a founder.

Always reads JSON from stdin.

Usage:
    cat findings.json | python red_team.py --run-id 20260101T000000Z -o redteam.json

Output: JSON with accepted findings, rejected findings (each with its reason),
and a summary.

# The ONE non-web provenance a finding may claim: the sentence is from this run's own output.
#
# It exists because a real run produced exactly that shape -- the red team quoted the analysis'
# own comparison note back at it -- and, with only http(s) accepted, hung an unrelated external
# URL on it to get through. A link that does not contain the quote quietly breaks this step's
# whole promise, which is that every finding carries the sentence it relies on.
#

# accepted "closer to $66 than $203" and "5.1 billed months rather than 12", and it REFUSED
# "the recurring rate is actually $203 on n=17" -- a correct finding quoting its source to
# correct a misread, which is the single most valuable shape this step produces. A negative
# rule over prose cannot separate those, because the difference is not in the grammar.

# sentence came from can be checked by the founder, and one that cannot is an opinion no matter

# n=47" -- had no legal source and was dropped as unsourced. The step that should catch a misread
