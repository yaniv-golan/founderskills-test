# Financial Model Review — Input Schemas

Schemas for artifacts the agent writes during the review workflow. For output schemas (what scripts produce), see `artifact-schemas.md`.

---

## Stub Format (skipped artifacts)

When a pipeline step is skipped (e.g., insufficient data for unit economics), deposit a stub instead of the full artifact:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `skipped` | boolean | yes | Always `true` |
| `reason` | string | yes | Human-readable explanation |
| `metadata` | object | yes | Must carry `metadata.run_id` matching the run's other artifacts (run_id-parity exempts the stub from the value check but still requires the key to be present) |

Example:

    {"skipped": true, "reason": "Insufficient quantitative data for unit economics computation", "metadata": {"run_id": "<RUN_ID>"}}

`compose_report.py` detects stubs via `_is_stub()` and renders them as informational notes in the report. Stubs are valid for: `unit_economics.json`, `runway.json`, `model_data.json`.

---

## inputs.json

**Producer:** Context A dispatch (INPUTS_REVIEW) → `apply_corrections.py` → promoted to `inputs.json`. A direct heredoc write of `inputs.json` is the last-resort fallback only.

Canonical structured input for all downstream scripts. The `company` block is required; all other blocks are optional and populated based on what the model contains.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `company` | object | yes | Company profile |
| `currency` | string | no | ISO 4217 currency code for the model's native currency (e.g., `"USD"`, `"INR"`, `"ILS"`). **Absent ⇒ treated as USD-equivalent** (back-compat default; all downstream USD-denominated benchmarks apply unchanged). See "currency" below for the preserve-native rule. |
| `metadata` | object | no | Extraction metadata (periodicity, conversion, overrides) |
| `revenue` | object | no | Revenue and growth data |
| `expenses` | object | no | Headcount, OpEx, COGS |
| `cash` | object | no | Cash position and fundraising |
| `unit_economics` | object | no | CAC, LTV, payback, margins |
| `scenarios` | object | no | Base/slow/crisis scenario parameters |
| `structure` | object | no | Model structural quality signals |
| `israel_specific` | object | no | Israel-specific cost and compliance data |
| `bridge` | object | no | Fundraising bridge and milestones |

### metadata

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `source_periodicity` | string | no | Periodicity detected from the source model. One of: `"monthly"`, `"quarterly"`, `"annual"`, `"mixed"`, `"unknown"`. |
| `conversion_applied` | string | no | Conversion applied to flow metrics. One of: `"none"`, `"divided_by_3"`, `"divided_by_12"`. |
| `run_id` | string | no | Unique identifier for this review run (ISO timestamp or UUID). Used by `compose_report.py` to detect stale artifacts. |
| `warning_overrides` | object[] | no | Critical warnings the agent investigated and chose to proceed past. |

#### warning_overrides[] entry

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `code` | string | yes | Warning code from `validate_inputs.py` (e.g., `"BURN_MULTIPLE_SUSPECT"`) |
| `reason` | string | yes | Why the warning was overridden |
| `reviewed_by` | string | yes | One of: `"agent"`, `"founder"` |
| `timestamp` | string | yes | ISO 8601 timestamp |

### currency

The model's native currency, as an ISO 4217 code (`"USD"`, `"INR"`, `"ILS"`, `"EUR"`, ...).

**Rule: PRESERVE the model's native currency — never force-convert to USD.** Set `currency` to whatever currency the source model is denominated in; do not translate values to USD during extraction, even if the model states its own FX rate. If the model states an FX rate, record it as a note (e.g., in `metadata`) for downstream reference — do NOT apply it to convert any monetary values. Converting on some runs and preserving native currency on others is what produces cross-run magnitude divergence (e.g., a model appearing ~80x larger on one run than another) — always preserving is what removes the coin-flip.

**Absent `currency` ⇒ USD-equivalent.** This is the back-compat default: existing `inputs.json` files without a `currency` field are treated exactly as before, and all USD-denominated benchmarks (e.g., the burn-multiple and Rule of 40 ARR floors below) apply unchanged.

**When `currency` is present and not `"USD"`:**

- `unit_economics.py` and `runway.py` do not compare native-denominated values against hardcoded USD thresholds — see "ARR Floor Behavior" under `unit_economics` below.
- Every dollar-formatted evidence/warning string across `unit_economics.py` and `runway.py` (CAC, LTV, ARR/FTE, cash balance, monthly burn, runway warnings, IIA grant amounts) is currency-tagged (e.g. `"1.5M INR"`) instead of a bare `$` sign. The only bare-`$` strings left in either script are the USD ARR-floor "not meaningful below" / "not benchmark-compared below" messages (the `$500K` burn-multiple floor, the `$1M` and `$5M` Rule-of-40 floors), and they are unreachable for a non-USD model: each of those floor gates is skipped for non-USD currencies (see below), so those strings only ever render when currency is absent/`"USD"`.
- `unit_economics.json` and `runway.json` both echo the resolved `currency` in their own output, so downstream consumers don't need to re-read `inputs.json`.
- `compose_report.py` (report.md) and `visualize.py` (the HTML artifact) read that echoed `currency` and format every dollar-denominated figure the same way — CAC/LTV in the Unit Economics table, net cash/monthly burn/monthly revenue/raise amounts in the Runway section, and the ARR figures in the executive summary and charts.
- `runway.py`'s burn-based cash-sensitivity table (used when `cash.current_balance` is missing) is a fixed grid of round-number USD cash levels ($500K–$5M) — a USD-hypothetical illustration, not a native-currency one. For a non-USD model this table is skipped (with an explanatory warning) rather than mislabeling those USD figures as native-currency amounts.
- `validate_extraction.py`'s SCALE_PLAUSIBILITY check skips its USD-absolute floors (cash-balance stage range, $2K/person/month gross expense, $10K/year salary) for a non-USD model, and its `--fix` auto-correction path can never trigger off a USD floor applied to non-USD data. The scale-indicator text-pattern match (e.g. `"($000)"`) is unaffected, since it describes display scale, not currency.

### company

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `company_name` | string | yes | Company name |
| `slug` | string | yes | URL-safe identifier |
| `stage` | string | yes | One of: `"pre-seed"`, `"seed"`, `"series-a"`, `"series-b"`, `"later"` |
| `sector` | string | yes | Normalized sector string |
| `geography` | string | yes | Primary geography |
| `revenue_model_type` | string | yes | One of: `"saas-plg"`, `"saas-sales-led"`, `"marketplace"`, `"usage-based"`, `"ai-native"`, `"hardware"`, `"hardware-subscription"`, `"consumer-subscription"`, `"transactional-fintech"`, `"annual-contracts"`, `"retail"` |
| `model_format` | string | no | One of: `"spreadsheet"`, `"deck"`, `"conversational"`, `"partial"`. Defaults to `"spreadsheet"`. Controls which checklist items are applicable. |
| `data_confidence` | string | no | One of: `"exact"`, `"estimated"`, `"mixed"`. Indicates reliability of input values. |

**Choosing `revenue_model_type` when the founder just says "B2B SaaS".** Decide on **motion, not
product**: a named salesperson or AE in the loop, or a stated ACV above ~$25k, or "we do demos/pilots"
⇒ `saas-sales-led`. Self-serve signup, free tier, or product-led trial ⇒ `saas-plg`. Either way,
**record the choice in `agent_supplied`** so it is disclosed rather than invisible.

**With no signal either way, the two SaaS variants are interchangeable — do not agonise.** Verified:
nothing in the fleet distinguishes them. Both sit in `_SAAS_MODEL_TYPES` and `_KNOWN_SAAS_LIKE_TYPES`,
both map to `"saas"` in `checklist.py`, and CAC payback keys on `acv_tier`, not on model type. This
paragraph previously said to default to `saas-sales-led` "(the more conservative CAC-payback band)" —
a band it does not control, between two values no code tells apart.

**What DOES matter is when neither fits.** `revenue_model_type` is required and has no "unknown", so a
business the enum cannot express — outcome-priced, or deep tech that ships software — falls through to
a SaaS default and switches on the whole SaaS metric suite (NRR, GRR, magic number, Rule of 40,
ARR/FTE) plus the SaaS gross-margin table. Prefer the closest NON-SaaS type over a SaaS one you do not
believe, and say in `agent_supplied` that the taxonomy did not fit.

**Choosing `data_confidence` for conversational input.** A figure the founder stated from memory in chat is
`estimated`, not `exact`. Reserve `exact` for a value read off a document — a spreadsheet cell, a bank
statement, a deck slide. If some figures came from a document and some from conversation, that is what
`mixed` is for. Getting this wrong is not cosmetic: `unit_economics.py` appends a confidence qualifier to
rated metrics, so a conversational estimate labelled `exact` presents a remembered number as a measured one.
| `traits` | string[] | no | Boolean trait flags: `"multi-currency"`, `"multi-entity"`, `"multi-market"`, `"annual-contracts"`, `"ai-powered"` — product uses AI/ML inference as a core feature (triggers AI cost scrutiny regardless of revenue model) |

#### `model_format` pipeline effects

| Format | Checklist | Unit economics / Runway | Report header |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| `spreadsheet` | All 46 items evaluated | Full computation | "Model Quality" |
| `deck` | STRUCT_01–09, CASH_20–32 auto-gated (22 items) | Agent decides (typically stubs) | "Deck Financial Readiness" |
| `conversational` | Same as `deck` | Agent decides (typically stubs) | "Deck Financial Readiness" |
| `partial` | All 46 items evaluated | Full computation | "Model Quality" |

Additional effects for `deck` / `conversational`:
- `compose_report.py --strict`: Only high-severity warnings (corrupt/missing artifacts) block; checklist failures are review findings, not data errors

### revenue

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `customers` | number | no | Current customer count. Required at seed+ when LTV inputs are provided. |
| `monthly` | object[] | no | Monthly revenue time series |
| `quarterly` | object[] | no | Quarterly revenue time series (use instead of `monthly` when source data is quarterly) |
| `arr` | object | no | Annual recurring revenue snapshot |
| `mrr` | object | no | Monthly recurring revenue snapshot |
| `monthly_total` | number | no | Fallback when `mrr` is absent for non-SaaS models |
| `growth_rate_monthly` | number | no | Month-over-month growth rate (decimal). **NET of churn** — the observed month-over-month change in MRR, which is what a founder means by "growing 4% a month". Do NOT subtract a churn figure from it: `net_new_ARR = mrr × growth_rate_monthly × 12` already. Subtracting churn again double-counts it and understates net-new ARR. If the founder gives a GROSS new-business rate, net it yourself before writing this field, and note that in `metadata`. |
| `churn_monthly` | number | no | Monthly churn rate (decimal) |
| `nrr` | number | no | Net revenue retention (decimal) |
| `grr` | number | no | Gross revenue retention (decimal) |
| `expansion_model` | string | no | Description of expansion revenue mechanism |

#### monthly[] entry

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `month` | string | yes | `"YYYY-MM"` format |
| `actual` | boolean | yes | `true` for actuals, `false` for projections |
| `total` | number | yes | Total revenue for the month |
| `arr` | number | no | Annualized run-rate at this point in time. When present, used for TTM burn multiple. When absent, `total * 12` is used as approximation. |
| `drivers` | object | no | Breakdown (e.g., `customers`, `arpu_monthly`) |

#### quarterly[] entry

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `quarter` | string | yes | `"YYYY-QN"` format (e.g., `"2024-Q1"`) |
| `actual` | boolean | yes | `true` for actuals, `false` for projections |
| `total` | number | yes | Total revenue for the quarter |
| `arr` | number | no | Annualized run-rate at quarter end. Used for YoY burn multiple computation. |
| `drivers` | object | no | Breakdown (e.g., `customers`, `arpu_monthly`) |

#### arr / mrr

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `value` | number | yes | ARR or MRR value |
| `as_of` | string | yes | `"YYYY-MM"` snapshot date |

### expenses

| `count` | integer | yes | Number of hires |
| `start_month` | string | yes | `"YYYY-MM"` start date |
| `salary_annual` | number | yes | Annual salary |
| `geography` | string | no | Role geography (for burden calculation) |
| `burden_pct` | number | no | Employer burden as decimal (e.g., 0.30) |

#### opex_monthly[] entry

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `category` | string | yes | Expense category |
| `amount` | number | yes | Monthly amount |
| `start_month` | string | yes | `"YYYY-MM"` start date |

#### cogs

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `hosting` | number | no | Cloud/hosting costs |
| `inference_costs` | number | no | AI/ML inference costs |
| `support` | number | no | Customer support costs |
| `other` | number | no | Other COGS |

### cash

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `current_balance` | number | yes | Current cash balance |
| `debt` | number | no | Outstanding debt (default 0); used for net cash calculation |
| `balance_date` | string | yes | `"YYYY-MM"` balance date |
| `monthly_net_burn` | number | yes | Net monthly burn rate. **Sign convention: positive = cash outgoing** (e.g., if the company burns $500K/month, write `500000`, not `-500000`). The script will defensively abs() negative values, but correct sign avoids warnings. |
| `fundraising` | object | no | Fundraising parameters |
| `grants` | object | no | Government grant data |

#### fundraising

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `target_raise` | number | yes | Target raise amount |
| `expected_close` | string | yes | `"YYYY-MM"` expected close date |

**Top-level `agent_supplied`** (array of dotted field paths, conversational/deck runs): the fields **you**
supplied rather than the founder. `[]` means the founder stated everything; **absent** means the question
was never answered, which `validate_inputs.py` flags as `UNDECLARED_AGENT_VALUE`. Every entry must also
appear in the Step 3.6 Path B confirmation table before math runs on it. Currently checked against:
`bridge.runway_target_months`, `bridge.raise_amount`, `fundraising.target_raise`,
`fundraising.expected_close`, `growth.growth_rate_monthly`.

#### grants

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `iia_approved` | number | no | Approved IIA grant amount |
| `iia_pending` | number | no | Pending IIA grant amount |
| `iia_disbursement_months` | integer | no | Months over which to disburse IIA grant (default 12) |
| `iia_start_month` | integer | no | Month offset from balance_date to start disbursement (default 1) |
| `royalty_rate` | number | no | Royalty repayment rate (decimal) |

### unit_economics

| `ltv` | object | no | Lifetime value |
| `payback_months` | number | no | CAC payback period in months |
| `gross_margin` | number | no | Gross margin (decimal) |
| `gross_margin_basis` | string | no | What the `gross_margin` figure measures. One of: `"product"` (revenue minus cost of goods/service delivery — the default assumption), `"store_contribution"` (store/restaurant-level margin after location labor and occupancy), `"net_revenue"`, `"gross_revenue"`, `"blended"`. Benchmarks assume `product`; any other declared basis rates `contextual` because it is not comparable to the product-GM tables. Set this for store/franchise rollouts so a store-level margin is not judged against a merchandise-margin bar. |
| `burn_multiple` | number | no | Optional; used as fallback when computation inputs (`monthly_net_burn`, `mrr`, `growth_rate_monthly`) are missing. When present alongside compute inputs, the computed value takes precedence |

#### ARR Floor Behavior (currency-aware)

burn_multiple and rule_of_40 are currency-agnostic RATIOS (net burn ÷ net-new ARR; growth% + margin%) — only their materiality floors and stage-benchmark tables are USD-denominated: burn multiple gates on a $500K ARR floor, Rule of 40 on a $1M ARR floor (and a $5M floor below which it is shown but not benchmark-compared on the operating-margin path), and both then rate against a USD-calibrated stage-benchmark table.

When top-level `currency` is present and not `"USD"`, `unit_economics.py` cannot verify either the ARR floor or the stage benchmark against a native-currency ARR value — but the ratio itself is still valid and still computed. Both floor-gates are skipped for a non-USD model (never gating the metric to `not_applicable` off a raw non-USD number), the ratio is computed exactly as it would be for USD, and the resulting rating is downgraded from a benchmark grade (`strong`/`acceptable`/`warning`/`fail`) to `contextual` with a caveat noting the benchmark/floor couldn't be verified. This is applied uniformly whether or not `revenue.arr.value` happens to be present — the currency-aware treatment must not depend on ARR presence, since basing it on a field the model may or may not carry would make the review's rigor a function of which fields the extraction happened to fill in, not of the actual data. When `currency` is absent or `"USD"`, both metrics rate exactly as before.

**The withheld grade is preserved as a reference.** Suppressing both floors at once left a non-USD review with numbers and no assessment, which matters most for the founders most likely to file in a local currency. So the grade the comparison already produced is kept on the metric as `benchmark_reference_rating`, alongside `benchmark_reference` (the threshold), `benchmark_reference_source`, `benchmark_reference_as_of`, and a `benchmark_reference_note` that labels it. Rules:

- The **primary `rating` stays `contextual`** — it is a reliance boundary, not a confidence score. The reference never becomes the verdict.
- **No FX rate is involved, and none is invented.** These stage thresholds are *dimensionless* (burn multiple 2.0x/2.5x/3.0x, gross margin 0.70/0.60/0.50, Rule of 40 as a sum of percentages), so the comparison is exact rather than converted. What genuinely needs a rate is any **absolute** threshold — the $500K/$1M/$5M ARR materiality floors, and the ACV-tier boundaries that select a CAC-payback band — and those stay suppressed.
- The withholding is therefore about USD-market **calibration**, not unit incompatibility. The note says so, so a founder is not left thinking the ratio was unmeasurable.
- **USD reviews gain no reference fields at all** — this is purely additive.

**Scope:** the caveat is applied to `burn_multiple` and `rule_of_40` only. `ltv_cac` is a dimensionless ratio with no ARR floor attached and keeps its ordinary grade in any currency — it was never suppressed.

### Sector Gate Mapping

- `SECTOR_39` (marketplace): triggers for `marketplace`
- `SECTOR_40` (AI inference): triggers for `ai-native`, `usage-based`, `ai-powered` (via `company.traits`), or when `expenses.cogs` contains AI cost keys (`inference_costs`, `ai_infrastructure`, `ai_compute`, `gpu_costs`, `model_inference`)
- `SECTOR_41` (hardware): triggers for `hardware`, `hardware-subscription`
- `SECTOR_42` (usage-based margin): triggers for `usage-based`
- `SECTOR_43` (consumer retention): triggers for `consumer-subscription`
- `SECTOR_44` (deferred revenue): triggers for `annual-contracts`
- `retail` maps to sector type `retail` and — like the SaaS types — matches no sector-specific item; the mapping exists so retail companies are not forced into `hardware` to satisfy gating. Gross margin is benchmarked against the retail sector table regardless.

### LTV Cap Behavior

When `unit_economics.ltv.inputs.churn_monthly` is 0%, LTV is mathematically infinite. The script caps the value at a 60-month (5-year) horizon: `arpu_monthly * gross_margin * 60`. The evidence field labels this as "capped at 5-year horizon, 0% churn assumed". If `arpu_monthly` or `gross_margin` is missing, the cap cannot be computed — the original LTV value passes through but is marked `not_rated` with evidence noting the cap could not be applied.
