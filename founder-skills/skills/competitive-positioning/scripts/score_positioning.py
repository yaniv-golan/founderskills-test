"""
Competitive positioning scorer.

Takes pair-centric positioning views from positioning.json and produces
scored output with rank-based differentiation scores, vanity axis detection,
and stress-test passthrough.

Always reads JSON from stdin.

Usage:
    echo '{"views": [...], "differentiation_claims": [...], ...}' \
        | python score_positioning.py --pretty

Output: JSON with per-view scores, overall differentiation, and warnings.
