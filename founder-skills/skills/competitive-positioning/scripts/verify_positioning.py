"""Delivery gate for competitive positioning.

Validates that the deliverable actually SHOWS what the analysis found, and that no internal
token reached the founder. Exit 0 = publishable, exit 1 = gaps remain.

WHY THIS EXISTS — read before adding or relaxing a check.

Three of the worst defects this skill has shipped were the same shape: analysis that was
computed, paid for, and then never rendered.

  * Axis rationales were written on every run and read from the wrong place, so `report.md`
    showed blank "Rationale:" lines and both HTML surfaces dropped the axis caption — while
    the 25-point review graded POS_05 ("axis rationale explains differentiation value") as a
    PASS on text no founder could see.
  * The explorer embedded the entire scored layer (differentiation score, ranks, vanity flags,
    claim verdicts) and its JavaScript read none of it.
  * The adversarial competitor verdicts reached no renderer, so a competitor judged
    `not_a_competitor` was scored, ranked and tabled indistinguishably from a genuine one.

None of those was caught by a unit test, because each producer was individually correct. They
were caught by reading one live run's artifacts against what actually reached the founder — a
$9-15 instrument, non-deterministic, exercising one path. That does not scale, and it is not
what should stand between a defect and a founder.

So the rule this file enforces is: **a run may not complete while the deliverable is missing
something the artifacts already contain, or while it contains something the founder cannot
use.** Compliance with prose becomes a quality-of-life matter rather than a correctness one,
because a non-compliant run cannot finish.

Modelled deliberately on `financial-model-review/scripts/verify_review.py`, which already had
this shape. Keep the two structurally similar — a reader who knows one should recognise the other.

Usage:
    python verify_positioning.py --dir <artifacts_dir> [--gate {1,2}] [--pretty] [-o <file>]

Gate levels:
    1 = mid-pipeline (artifacts only; report/HTML not expected yet)
    2 = end-of-run, pre-delivery (default) — everything, including the rendered surfaces
