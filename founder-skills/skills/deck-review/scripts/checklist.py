"""
Deck review checklist scorer.

Validates 35 criteria across 7 categories with pass/fail/warn/not_applicable
scoring. Computes overall score percentage and status.

Always reads JSON from stdin.

Usage:
    echo '{"items": [{"id": "purpose_clear", "status": "pass", "evidence": "...", "notes": "..."}, ...]}' \
        | python checklist.py --pretty

Output: JSON with validated items and summary.
