"""
Compose deck review report from structured JSON artifacts.

Reads all JSON artifacts from a directory, validates completeness and
cross-artifact consistency, assembles a markdown report.

Usage:
    python compose_report.py --dir ./deck-review-acme-corp/ --pretty

Output: JSON to stdout with report_markdown and validation results.
