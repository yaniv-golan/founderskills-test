"""Verify a deck's numeric ledger and compute the relations proposed over it.

The skill has always scored `numbers_consistent` as one of its 35 criteria on the model's
say-so, and has never done arithmetic. This is where the arithmetic happens.

THE DIVISION OF LABOUR, and why it is this way:

  the model  chooses WHICH figures relate      -- judgment, and the thing F5 needs
  this file  does the arithmetic               -- deterministic, correct by construction
  this file  refuses relations it cannot trust -- gate + unit algebra
  the model  interprets the result             -- judgment, labelled as such

The failure this addresses is OMISSION, not miscalculation: the reviewer held every
operand and never multiplied. So the behaviour change comes from asking for relations at
all. This file's contribution is that the resulting number is right, that it is
traceable, and that SKILL.md's "never arithmetic in prose" rule has a sanctioned outlet.

WHAT THE GATE ESTABLISHES, precisely. A figure's quote passes if it is re-found by a
second reader who never saw the ledger. That catches a quote that is not in the deck at
all -- invented, or composed out of a chart. It does NOT catch rewording: matching falls
back to a similarity ratio at 0.85 (`_quote_match.py`), and measured against the shipped
matcher, "increased" vs "decreased", "double" vs "decline" and "$45 billion" vs
"$46 billion" all pass.
It does NOT establish that the figure's VALUE is correct -- the matcher deliberately
omits value binding, see `_quote_match.py` -- and the second reader does not read the
deck independently of the first: both are handed the same main-thread-extracted text,
so the two readings descend from one act of reading, not two. It says nothing about
ATTRIBUTION either, which is tracked separately below and is the weaker link.

The calibration numbers this docstring used to cite here (95.7-100% true-pass, 0.0%
cross-deck false-pass, 0.0% on invented quotes) described a PROTOTYPE design -- a
genuinely independent vision transcription -- that was never shipped. They are kept
here, marked as such, rather than deleted, because they describe a design that was
considered, not the gate that runs today.

# marked the 3 approximate. Measured on the corpus, `target|projected|est` alone accounted
# for 57 of 81 approximations (70%), 24 of them load-bearing inside a computed relation.
#
# `projected` is the deliberate call, and it went the other way on purpose. A projection is
# uncertain about the WORLD; the figure itself is still stated exactly, and a forecast that
# does not add up is a finding. Widening tolerance there made the tool most forgiving
# exactly where a founder's arithmetic most often fails. "Projected MRR $205,000" now gets

#
# SYMBOLS AND WORDS ARE SEPARATE BECAUSE THEY ARE READ FROM DIFFERENT PLACES. `detect_bound`
# states the rule -- symbols come from `raw` ONLY, because a label's symbol routinely
# qualifies something other than the figure. The approximate branch used to search a single
# combined pattern against `raw` AND `label`, so a `~` anywhere in a label widened tolerance
# by `APPROX_WIDENING` on a figure that was never marked approximate. Measured: a summed
# 108 against a stated 100 returns `contradiction`, but with an unrelated `~` or `≈` in the
# label it returns `confirmation` -- a real finding erased by a glyph belonging to a
# different number. The `>200m` case pinned in `test_a_symbol_in_the_label_is_never_read_as_a_bound`
# was already guarded; this closes the same hole on the approximate path.
#
# `≈` (U+2248) sits with `~`, and reaches less than it looks like it should: this function
# sees `raw` and `label`, never `quote`. A deck that prints a bare bar value and carries the
# `≈` only in the surrounding sentence puts the glyph where nothing here can read it. Binding
# an approximation marker from the quote to the figure is a separate problem.
# The symbol must qualify THIS figure's number, so it has to appear BEFORE the first
# numeric token -- the same token `_parsed_magnitude` reads the magnitude from -- and there
# has to be a number for it to qualify. `raw` is supposed to be one figure's own printed
# string, but the schema permits any string and nothing enforces it, so a whole-string
# search marks "$100 vs 2024 ≈ 20" approximate off a glyph belonging to a different number,
# and a bare "≈" (which `ledger.py` also accepts, since it skips the scale check when `raw`
# has no parseable magnitude) marks a figure approximate off no number at all. Both widen
# tolerance to 10% and can only erase a contradiction. No corpus instance of either shape

    Measured on one live ledger: `≈` appeared in **0 of 81 `raw` values and 7 quotes** — the
    seven chart bars a deck printed bare while marking them approximate in the surrounding
    sentence. Reading `raw` and `label` alone reaches none of them, so those figures were
    carried as exact claims and could be reported as contradicting a number the deck itself
    said was approximate. That is the false-contradiction direction this module treats as
    the worst thing it can emit.

    THE BINDING IS TIGHTER THAN THE `raw` RULE, NOT LOOSER, and it has to be. `raw` is
    supposed to be one figure's own printed string, so "the glyph precedes the first number"
    is nearly always the right reading there. A quote is a whole sentence and routinely names
    several figures, so the same rule would let a glyph belonging to one number qualify
    another -- the exact hole that was closed on the `raw` path, reopened one field over.
    Here the figure's own printed string must be located inside the quote and the glyph must
    sit IMMEDIATELY before it, whitespace only.

    A figure whose `raw` does not appear verbatim in its own quote reads NO bound. The quote
    is required to be verbatim, so that is either a paraphrase or a differently-formatted
    number, and neither lets a glyph be positioned relative to the figure. Guessing is not

"material, and not open to interpretations" -- so it gets its own mechanism rather than a
quietly widened tolerance.

A CHOICE, and one that cannot be validated from the data that motivated it: every threshold
between 1.42% and 14.28% behaves identically on the corpus. What IS measured is that no
expert-confirmed real finding comes close -- the smallest percent-space relative gap on a
real finding is 43.9%, twenty times this floor.

Scoped to percentages on purpose. A 2% gap on a cash or headcount figure can matter, and
there is no evidence here for a general materiality floor.

    the assertion test's tolerance inverted that, and is what let a false finding through:

    425% growth IS 5.25x. The offset was 0.532 percentage points against a band of 0.5 --
    it missed by 0.032. The band was the STATED figure's precision alone, because
    `operand_tolerance` contributes nothing for multiplicative operators (deliberately, and
    correctly, for disjointness -- see its docstring). But the computed side is built from
    rounded operands: $493k and $94k carry 0.101% and 0.532%, and a ratio's relative errors
    add, so the honest excursion is +/-3.3 points. A fixed 0.5 band against a 3.3 spread
    could only ever miss, and it misses MORE as multiples grow and operands coarsen.

    THE CAP IS LOAD-BEARING, not tidiness. `figure_tolerance` is a `max()` of the
    significant-figure floor and the relative rule, so the FLOOR ESCAPES `CAP`: "$1M"

Each class is here because the corpus contains a finding the expert graded not-a-problem for
exactly that reason, and because the convention-classes work established that no deterministic
rule can catch it: partial enumeration needs to know whether a breakdown was presented as
complete, and the approximate case sits at 14.3% relative, above any materiality floor that
does not also swallow genuine 12% errors.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and this is the important part. The original Phase 3 spec's
motivating class was "the relation was mis-specified" -- the model picked `increase_by` where
the deck meant a multiple -- with `$26B increased by 400% = 130B vs a stated $104B` as the
example, since 26 x 4 = 104 EXACTLY under the sibling operator. That is a compelling mechanical
tell and it is wrong: the expert graded BOTH deck-F items **real**, two days after the spec was
written. A deck writing "400%" where it means 4x has made exactly the kind of imprecision an
analyst catches, which is what this skill exists to surface.

So the corpus contains zero positive evidence for a mis-specification class and one strong
counterexample. Adding it would invite the model to withdraw precisely the findings the expert
kept -- the same mistake the sign-convention rule nearly made before review caught it. If a
future corpus produces a real mis-specified relation, add the class then, with the case attached.
