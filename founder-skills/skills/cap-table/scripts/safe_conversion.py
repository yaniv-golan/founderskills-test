"""SAFE conversion math (YC post-money primer + Cooley/NVCA references).

Implements `safe.post_money_cap_conversion` and `safe.discount_rate_semantics`
from `cap-table-rules.json` (v0.2.8+). The `company_capitalization` denominator
is supplied by the caller (typically `cap_state.as_converted_totals.fully_diluted_shares`
per the §5.1 binding table) and MUST be the pre-financing snapshot.

Per Gotcha #3: `discount_multiplier = 0.80` means 20% discount (multiplier
form, not percent). Per Gotcha #1: never include new-money or post-financing
pool increases in `company_capitalization`.

Two output sets (per §5.1 cap-implied vs post-financing split):

  * Cap-implied set — works standalone with cap + company_capitalization
    only. Produces cap_implied_ownership, safe_price, cap-implied shares.
  * Post-financing set — requires a priced-round price (equity_financing_price)
    OR conversion_price_override. Produces conversion shares + ownership %.

Hard-rejected cases (see Gotcha #4):
  * yc_postmoney_discount with no priced round / override → caller's job
    (E_SAFE_REQUIRES_CONVERSION_EVENT).
  * yc_uncapped_mfn with no priced round / override / MFN trigger → same.

Usage as a library:

    """Cap-implied output for a SET of post-money SAFEs (standalone; no priced round).

    WHY THIS IS SET-LEVEL AND NOT PER-INSTRUMENT — the shape of the bug it fixes.

    The YC post-money SAFE's "Company Capitalization" is SELF-INCLUSIVE: it counts the shares
    issuable on conversion of the SAFEs themselves (rule `safe.company_capitalization_yc_post_money`
    — "including … converting securities"). That is the defining property of the post-money form and
    the reason an investor's percentage is locked against dilution from other SAFEs.

    The previous per-instrument version divided the cap by the PRE-financing FD count, which omits
    the converting SAFEs, and it was called once per SAFE with that same base. Two consequences, both
    shipped to founders:
      * the three outputs disagreed with each other — a $500k SAFE at a $5M post cap against 8,000,000
        shares rendered as "10.0% cap-implied (800,000 shares)", and 800,000 shares is 9.09%;
      * the priced-round path, which solves the fixed point, returned 888,889 shares for the SAME
        instrument, so one report converted one SAFE two ways.

    The denominator is a fixed point, and the rule pack already states its closed form
    (`safe.stacked_post_money_caps`, which no producer implemented until now):

        pct_i  = purchase_i / cap_i
        total  = pre_financing_fd / (1 - Σ pct_i)
        price_i = cap_i / total
        shares_i = purchase_i / price_i          ( = pct_i × total )

    `pre_financing_fd` is the PRE-financing fully-diluted count — the name is deliberate. It already
    includes options outstanding, the available pool and vested warrants (`cap_state.py`), which the
    rule also requires. It is NOT the Company Capitalization; this function derives that (`total`)
    from it. The identically-named parameter on `convert_safe_priced_round` means the post-money CC,
    and conflating the two is how this defect happened.

    ALL-OR-NOTHING BY DESIGN: if any SAFE in the set cannot be priced, the whole set is rejected. A
    dropped member would be missing from `total` while still being a converting security, silently
    inflating every other SAFE's share count.
