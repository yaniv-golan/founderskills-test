"""Concise answer from the deterministic engine — the lightweight math path.

Renders the headline numbers a founder asked for straight from `scenarios.json`
(the solver's `computed_outputs`), plus any counsel / date-sensitive flags from
`rule_audit.json`, into a short cited markdown answer — WITHOUT the heavy tail
(no HTML, no interactive explorer, no counsel packet, no coaching sub-agent).

Use for a single quick MATH question that is neither a pure eligibility/date
lookup (use `verify_one.py`) nor a priced-round gut-check (use `quick_assess.py`)
— e.g. a fully-diluted warrant count, an as-converted snapshot, a standalone
anti-dilution adjustment. The NUMBERS are identical to the full pipeline's: this
reads the same `run_scenario.py` output, it does not recompute. The only thing
dropped is production weight, never correctness.

Pipeline: cap_state -> rule_audit --phase=pre_math -> run_scenario
          -> rule_audit --phase=post_math (optional, cheap) -> concise_report.
