"""Minimal JSON-Schema-subset validator (stdlib only).

Supports: type (single value OR list of values, e.g. ["string", "null"]),
required, properties, items, enum. Returns a list of human-readable error
strings; empty list means valid. Error messages include a dotted/indexed
path so agents/scripts can pinpoint the offending field.

Unsupported keywords are silently ignored: $ref, oneOf, anyOf, allOf,
additionalProperties, patternProperties, pattern, minLength/maxLength,
minimum/maximum, format. Schema authors must not rely on them.

DEFERRED (Phase 3): enforcing `additionalProperties: false` end-to-end is the
generic catch-all for mis-keyed input fields (today an unknown key passes
silently and is ignored by the consumer). Prereqs before flipping it on:
(1) this validator gains real `additionalProperties` support; (2) the
producer-wide intentional-extras inventory is complete — see
`cap_state._INTENTIONAL_NON_SCHEMA_KEYS` (currently cap_state-only); (3) every
inventory key becomes a declared schema property or a documented exception.
Otherwise reject-mode would fail VALID inputs. Phase 1 instead handles the one
observed mis-key (anti_dilution) via a targeted recovery in cap_state.py.

Type-mismatch errors short-circuit further checks for that subtree to
avoid cascading errors on the wrong shape.

Why a hand-rolled validator: scripts in this repo are invoked via bare
python3, not uv run, so PEP 723 inline deps aren't honored at runtime.
