"""Coupled priced-round solver with anti-dilution.

Priced rounds have circular dependencies (option-pool top-up needs
new_money_shares; new_money_shares depends on equity_financing_price;
price depends on post-SAFE/note/pool FD; anti-dilution to existing
preferred series depends on the new PPS AND changes total FD via mutated
current_conversion_price). The solver iterates to a fixed point with all
adjusters in a single Banach loop.

Architecture (Adjuster Protocol):
  * Each adjuster wraps an existing math producer (anti_dilution.py,
    safe_conversion.py, note_conversion.py, option_pool.py) and runs in
    one of three stages per iteration:
      - adjust_cap_state: AntiDilutionAdjuster mutates CCP on each
        AD-protected preferred series. The mutation flows through
        cap_state._compute_as_converted_totals into total_FD.
      - convert_securities: SafeConversionAdjuster + NoteConversionAdjuster
        compute conversion shares against AD-adjusted total_FD and PPS.
      - size_round: PoolTopUpAdjuster + NewMoneyAdjuster size the new
        round shares.
  * Adjusters are pure functions of SolverState; the orchestrator applies
    their returned state_mutations.
  * MFN resolution stays STRUCTURAL (one-time pre-pass, not per-iter) —
    inheritance is PPS-independent.
  * CP1 (the original CCP per AD-protected series) is FROZEN at iter 0
    in `pre_financing_cp1_snapshots` to avoid ratchet-on-ratchet.
  * A denominator components are FROZEN at iter 0 in
    `pre_financing_a_components` per NVCA §4.4.4 "immediately prior to
    such issue."

Convergence:
  * Bare fixed-point iteration when |f'_est| < 0.9 (the typical regime).
  * Sign-flip detection triggers under-relaxation (α=0.5) on 3+ alternations.
  * Aitken Δ² acceleration engages when |f'_est| > 0.9 for 3+ iterations.
  * Aitken fallback fence: if projected step moves > 20× vanilla step,
    abort acceleration and revert to vanilla; emit warning.
  * Hard 200-iteration cap.
  * Convergence threshold: |Δp/p| < 1e-6 AND |Δp| < 1e-9.

Backwards compatibility:
  * When no preferred series has anti_dilution_protection != none, the
    AntiDilutionAdjuster short-circuits — output is semantically
    identical to a no-AD solver. Old-shape fields bit-for-bit; new optional
    fields (anti_dilution_breakdown, founders_pct_pre_anti_dilution) are
    added with no-op values.

    Per the YC MFN provision, a SAFE that has `mfn_provision.elected_against_safe_id`

    inherits that sibling's terms. Without auto-binding, the solver would
    require `conversion_price_override` on every MFN-electing SAFE — needless
    friction for the canonical case.

    Multi-hop resolution: A→B→C chains are resolved transitively by iterating
    to a fixed point. Each pass resolves any `yc_uncapped_mfn` whose election
    target now has a resolved (non-uncapped-MFN) form; iteration continues
    until no further resolutions happen. Bounded by `len(safes)` iterations
    since each pass either resolves at least one SAFE or terminates.

    Truly unresolvable cases (election to a missing sibling, all-uncapped
    cycles) are left unchanged — `detect_mfn_cycles` and the rejection path
    in `convert_safe_priced_round` handle them per Gotcha #4.

    MFN resolution is STRUCTURAL (one-time pre-pass, NOT per-iteration).
