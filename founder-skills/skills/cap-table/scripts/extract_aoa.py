"""Anti-hallucination validator + ingest helper for AoA extraction.

Lane-1 AoA documents (Articles of Association — Israeli Ltd or Delaware C-corp
foundational governance docs) use the dedicated Context A sub-context
`ARTICLES_OF_ASSOCIATION_EXTRACTION` rather than `INSTRUMENT_EXTRACTION`. The
sub-agent reads the AoA and returns a structured JSON shape describing the
per-preferred-series terms (OIP, liquidation preference, anti-dilution, etc.)
plus AoA-level metadata (drag-along threshold, §102 plan reference).

This script:
  1. Validates the extraction JSON against the schema-canonical
     `preferred_series` item shape (matches cap_state.schema.json).
  2. Optionally merges the validated preferred_series block into an existing
     `inputs.json` (founder context already populated with company_name +
     jurisdiction + founders). `shares` is left null in the extraction —
     populated by founder input at merge time.
  3. Surfaces AoA-specific counsel-review items (drag-along < 75% in Israeli
     jurisdiction, §102 references absent when expected, etc.) for downstream
     rule_audit consumption.

Usage:
    cat aoa_extraction.json | python3 extract_aoa.py \\
        --run-id 20260521T120000Z \\
        --inputs $REVIEW_DIR/inputs.json \\  # for merge mode (writes new
                                              # preferred_series back to inputs.json)
        --source-doc /path/to/aoa.pdf \\
        --pretty

The dispatching agent then calls AskUserQuestion to fill in `shares` per
series + any low-confidence fields the validator flagged.

Schema: `extraction_type: "articles_of_association"` (NOT `instrument_type`).
Output goes to `inputs.json.preferred_series[]`, NOT
`instruments.json.convertible_notes[]`.
