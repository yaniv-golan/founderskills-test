"""Israeli ↔ Delaware flip mechanics (v0.1 scope: share-for-share 1:1 only).

Per Gotcha #7: v0.1 supports only 1:1 share-for-share exchange. Other
ratios, partial roll-forward of SAFEs/CLAs, and option-plan continuity
adjustments are deferred to v0.2 with counsel-review.

SAFE/CLA conversion + pricing run as a SEPARATE priced-round scenario
before or after the flip — they're NOT collapsed into flip math.

Output:
  pre_flip_cap_state: input cap_state (for record)
  post_flip_cap_state: same shape, share-for-share copied
  per_holder_mapping: explicit list of (pre_entity, post_entity) for audit
  counsel_review_items: §102 continuity, IIA approval, §104H/§103K
                        route choice flags (counsel-review gated)
