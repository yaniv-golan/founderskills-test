"""Shared founder-facing renderer for `cap_state` warnings.

Single source of truth for the warning-callout block so the full report (`compose_report`) and the
concise answer (`concise_report`) cannot diverge: a warning family added here renders on both routes.

Bare-code warnings match by equality; the anti-dilution recovery warnings are interpolated SENTENCES
(`W_ANTI_DILUTION_*: …`) so they match by PREFIX — otherwise the recovery detail stays invisible to
the founder.

(Module is named `_warning_callouts`, not `_warnings`: `_warnings` is a CPython builtin backing the
stdlib `warnings` module, so `import _warnings` always resolves to the builtin and a sibling file of
that name is unreachable on `sys.path`.)

# `render_warning_callouts` takes `cap_state["warnings"]`, a list of STRINGS. The priced-round solver
# emits its warnings as DICTS onto `scenarios.json`'s `computed_outputs.warnings`, and the composer
# read that list in exactly two places, both testing for one unrelated code -- so every solver warning
# was computed, serialised, and then dropped before the report.
#
# That silence had a contract violation inside it: `agents/cap-table.md` states that when the solver
# emits W_MFN_NOT_MOST_FAVORABLE "the report should label it as such, not as the holder's actual
# entitlement." Nothing labelled it, so a counterfactual MFN election was presented to the founder as
# their entitlement.
#
# UNKNOWN CODES ARE RENDERED, NOT SKIPPED. A warning the solver thought worth emitting is worth
# showing even if this renderer has no bespoke prose for it; the alternative reintroduces exactly the
# silent-drop defect this function exists to fix. New solver warnings therefore surface by default and
# get better wording later, rather than being invisible until someone remembers to add a branch.
