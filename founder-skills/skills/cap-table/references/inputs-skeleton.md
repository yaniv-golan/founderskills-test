# inputs.json — common-case shape

The skill's SKILL.md Step 2 shows a minimal `inputs.json` heredoc that omits `founders`, `common_batches`, `preferred_series`, and `option_pool`. Those blocks are optional in `inputs.schema.json`, but **`cap_state.py` and most downstream rules need them to produce meaningful output**. Omitting the equity base entirely no longer passes silently: with instruments present and none of `founders`, `common_batches`, `preferred_series` or `option_pool`, `cap_state.py` hard-errors `E_NO_EQUITY_BASE` (exit 1) rather than computing an all-zero base for conversions to divide into. So a missing base STOPS the run — it does not produce plausible-looking zeros, and it is never a reason to invent founders or share counts. A single instrument with no surrounding cap table is the expected case for this and takes the **no-cap-base fork** in Step 2.

This reference shows the full common-case shape. Copy-and-fill for any engagement where someone actually owns shares.

## Validator strictness gotcha

`extract_cap_table.py --mode=validate` and the underlying `inputs.schema.json` do **not** declare `additionalProperties: false` at the root or on most sub-blocks. **Unknown top-level keys are silently dropped, without warning.** Common name-confusion pitfalls:

| Industry-conventional name | What this schema uses |
|---|---|
| `stakeholders[]` (Carta / Pulley) | `founders[]` |
| `option_pool.authorized_shares` | `option_pool.authorized` (bare, no `_shares`) |
| `option_pool.issued_shares` | `option_pool.issued` |
| `option_pool.unallocated_shares` | `option_pool.unallocated` |
| `option_pool.plan_type: "delaware_eip"` / `"none"` | `option_pool.plan_type: "iso"` (no enum exists for empty pool yet) |

If the validator passes but `cap_state.py` reports "founders: 0" or "preferred-as-converted: 0" against your expectation, suspect a name mismatch and re-check the keys.

## Minimal complete inputs.json (Delaware C-corp, single founder, empty pool, no preferred)

```json
{
  "company_name": "Example Corp",
  "analysis_date": "2026-05-21",
  "mode": "standard",
  "jurisdiction": {
    "structure": "delaware",
    "incorporated_date": "2024-06-01",
    "iia_grants_history": {"has_grants": false, "grant_details": []}
  },
  "event_dates": {
    "restructuring_effective_date": null,
    "restructuring_approval_date": null,
    "filing_date": null,
    "tax_position_date": null,
    "flip_closing_date": null,
    "benchmark_reference_date": null
  },
  "founders": [
    {"name": "Founder A", "founder_id": "founder_a", "common_shares": 10000000}
  ],
  "option_pool": {
    "plan_type": "iso",
    "authorized": 1500000,
    "issued": 0,
    "unallocated": 1500000
  },
  "engagement_questions": [],
  "metadata": {"run_id": "20260521T120000Z", "schema_version": "v0.5.0-inputs"}
}
```
**`incorporated_date` above is a PLACEHOLDER, not a default.** If the founder has not stated the date,
**delete that line** — `jurisdiction` has no `required` array, so omitting the key is schema-valid, while
`null` is not (the field is typed `string`). Ask for it when the engagement touches QSBS or §102 timing;
otherwise omit it and say so. A live run copied `2024-06-01` straight out of this example for a company
whose founder never gave a date, then drove a QSBS holding-period item off it — the same never-fabricate
rule as `issuance_date` applies here.

## Adding preferred-series (Series Seed BBWA, no prior AD)

Insert this block before `option_pool`:

```json
  "preferred_series": [
    {
      "series_id": "series_seed",
      "series_name": "Series Seed",
      "shares": 2000000,
      "original_issue_price": 1.00,
      "original_conversion_price": 1.00,
      "current_conversion_price": 1.00,
      "issuance_date": "2024-06-01",
      "liquidation_preference_multiple": 1.0,
      "liquidation_preference_type": "non_participating",
      "participation_cap_multiple": null,
      "anti_dilution_protection": "broad_based_weighted_average",
      "ad_cp2_floor": null,
      "ad_a_denominator_basis": null,
      "pro_rata_rights": true
    }
  ],
```

**Anti-dilution field (don't get this wrong — it drives the down-round adjustment).** The key is
`anti_dilution_protection`, and its value MUST be one of the canonical enum
`none | broad_based_weighted_average | narrow_based_weighted_average | full_ratchet` — NOT a shorthand
like `anti_dilution`/`bbwa`/`ratchet`. A wrong key or abbreviation that lands as `none` would silently
skip the anti-dilution math a founder asked for. `cap_state.py` recovers common slips and emits a
`W_ANTI_DILUTION_NONCANONICAL` warning so nothing is dropped silently, but write the canonical field
directly.

### Why three price fields

- `original_issue_price` (OIP) — per-share consideration investors paid. Two trigger conventions exist — the NVCA model tests CP1, some charters test the OIP (this pipeline's soft default). **The choice changes no number here:** both formulas are anchored on CP1 and return it unchanged at or above it, so the OIP convention widens only the range in which an adjustment is *attempted*.
- `original_conversion_price` (OCP) — drives the as-converted ratio. `preferred_shares_as_converted = shares × OCP / CCP` in `cap_state.py:_compute_as_converted_totals`.
- `current_conversion_price` (CCP) — the present conversion price. Equals OCP unless anti-dilution has previously triggered (CCP then < OCP).

For a fresh issuance with no prior AD: **OIP = OCP = CCP**. All three are required.

### The anti-dilution floor (`ad_cp2_floor`)

Optional, `null` for most charters — but supply it when yours has one. Many NVCA-form charters cap how
far an anti-dilution adjustment may push the conversion price down: *"in no event shall the Conversion
Price be reduced below the Original Issue Price"* (the floor is then the OIP) or a stated per-share
figure. Israeli AoAs put it as a proviso inside the "Adjustment of Conversion Price" article.

Omitting a floor the charter has is not cosmetic — the conversion price then falls further than the
charter allows, which inflates preferred-as-converted and **understates your ownership**. On a
representative down round: 11.11% founders with a $0.50 floor honoured, 5.95% with it missing.

The floor must be **below** the series' current conversion price. Equal to it admits no reduction at
all; above it is contradictory and the round math refuses it.

`ad_a_denominator_basis` (`nvca_broad` | `nvca_narrow` | `null`) picks which shares count in the
weighted-average denominator. Broad-based includes the option pool and other convertibles;
narrow-based counts only outstanding preferred, adjusting further and costing founders more — worth
0.24–0.47 percentage points. Left `null` it is derived from `anti_dilution_protection`, which is right
whenever the charter labels its protection consistently; set it only when the denominator language
disagrees with that label. A charter defining a third variant (e.g. excluding the unallocated reserve)
has no shape here — leave `null` and raise it with counsel.

## Recording a PRIOR down round (`cap_table_history`)

Optional, and absent for most companies. If a series has **already** been adjusted by a previous
down round, say so — otherwise the model has no way to know, and cannot tell you when the conversion
price you supplied looks stale.

```json
  "cap_table_history": [
    {
      "event_type": "anti_dilution_applied",
      "series_id": "series_seed",
      "previous_ccp": 1.00,
      "new_ccp": 0.80,
      "round_id": "series_a_2024",
      "applied_at": "2024-03-01"
    }
  ],
```

`event_type` and `series_id` are required; the rest are recorded when known. Supply this **together
with the adjusted price** — a series whose `current_conversion_price` still equals its
`original_conversion_price` while this history says it was adjusted is contradictory, and the model
flags it rather than silently trusting the higher price. That contradiction is the whole reason to
record the history: it is the only way the skill can catch a conversion price that was never updated
after a prior round.

## Adding common_batches (rare; advisor common, exercised options)

Insert this block after `founders`:

```json
  "common_batches": [
    {
      "holder_id": "advisor_jdoe",
      "shares": 100000,
      "issuance_date": "2024-09-01",
      "consideration": 100.0,
      "purpose": "restricted_stock_purchase"
    }
  ],
```

Omit the whole `common_batches` array if not applicable. `purpose` enum: `founder_issuance | restricted_stock_purchase | exercise | conversion | other`.

**Field-name discipline (avoids the recurring schema-thrash):** the holder reference is **`holder_id`** — there is **no `batch_id`** field on `common_batches` (a common mis-key; using `batch_id` is silently ignored / fails validation depending on the field). The only canonical item fields are: `holder_id`, `shares`, `issuance_date`, `consideration`, `purpose`, `common_class`, `voting_rights_multiple`. Warrants are **NOT** a top-level `inputs.json` array — they live in `instruments.json` (`warrants[]`); do not add a `warrants` key to `inputs.json`. `option_pool.plan_type` must be one of the §102/jurisdiction enums below — `iso | nso | section_102_cg | section_102_oi | section_3i | mixed` (not `102_cg` / `israeli_102` / `none`).

**`option_grants[]` — usually leave it EMPTY.** Individual option grants live in `instruments.json` `option_grants[]`, NOT `inputs.json`. You almost never need them: the **`option_pool` aggregate** (authorized / issued / unallocated) in `inputs.json` already captures the pool for cap-table math. Only populate `option_grants[]` for genuine per-grant detail (e.g. a specific §102 grant's vesting/tax analysis). In **Lane 3 (freeform)** individual grants are **not supported** — use an `option_pool_block`. If you DO build a grant, the required fields are exactly `id, holder_id, grant_date, shares_granted, strike_price, plan_type` (NOT `quantity` / `exercise_price` / `name` — those mis-keys fail validation). `strike_price` may be `null` ONLY when the source genuinely does not state it — the grant persists as a partial and `cap_state.py` emits `W_OPTION_GRANT_STRIKE_MISSING`; never fabricate a strike. When in doubt, write `"option_grants": []` and rely on the pool aggregate. **Flip carve-out:** when `mode=flip_focused` or a flip scenario is requested and the pool has issued grants, DO populate `option_grants[]` per holder with `plan_type` (tax route) and `grant_date` (+ `section_102_trustee_deposit_date` when known) even when `strike_price` is undisclosed (`null`) — §102 continuity analysis reads per-grant `plan_type`, not the pool aggregate, so an empty `option_grants[]` reports zero §102 grants. **Ordering:** populate `option_grants[]` AFTER any Lane-3 freeform emit for the same workspace — `--mode=freeform-emit` writes `instruments.json` wholesale (it does not merge existing instrument arrays), so grants authored before it are silently dropped.

## Option-pool plan_type by jurisdiction

| Jurisdiction | Typical plan_type |
|---|---|
| Delaware C-corp, ISO-eligible | `iso` |
| Delaware C-corp, NQSO-only | `nso` |
| Israeli, capital-gains track | `section_102_cg` |
| Israeli, ordinary-income track | `section_102_oi` |
| Israeli, non-employees | `section_3i` |
| Multi-track | `mixed` |

There is **no enum value for "no plan adopted yet" / "unallocated authorized"**. For a Delaware engagement with authorized-but-no-grants pool, use `iso` as the intended-tax-treatment placeholder.
